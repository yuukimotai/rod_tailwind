Someone (hopefully you) attempted to unlock TOTP authentication for the
account associated to this email address, but failed as the
authentication code submitted was not correct.

If you did not initiate the TOTP authentication failure that generated
this email, that means someone already has partial access to your
account, but is unable to use TOTP authentication to fully authenticate
themselves.
